# Geography 109:<br>Digital Mapping<br>Mapping 4: Introduction to QGIS

University of Kentucky
<br>Matthew W. Wilson

In this exercise, you will practice an industry-standard mapping workflow using open-sourced software. As such, it requires that you wrestle with data in ways that you might not have previously: **be patient**. By engaging more deeply with data, you will develop a better understanding of the moving parts that enter into the making of digital maps (but that are often hidden from their users). More specifically, this assignment will introduce data preparation practices using Microsoft Excel and visualization techniques in QGIS, a free and open-source (FOSS) software. 

**Note:** This assignment is divided into four stages and will be completed over the course of three recitation meetings. It is crucial that **you attend each recitation and arrive on time**.

## Grading.

The assignment is worth **50 points**, based on a Word document (or PDF) you will upload to Canvas containing:
1. Your two exportd maps (20 points).
2. Your responses to the questions listed in each stage (30 points).

Consult the [syllabus schedule](../syllabus.md#viii-schedule) for the due date of this assignment. **Note:** Late submissions will be penalized, as discussed in the syllabus.

**Note:** This assignment assumes that you will come to the first meeting on the Mapping 4 assignment in **Week 6** with QGIS already installed. Follow the instructions carefully in Stage 1, below.
