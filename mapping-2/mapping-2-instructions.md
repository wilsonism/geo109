After completing this assignment, you will have 1) the ability to navigate ArcGIS Pro and 2) a basic understanding of the file and data structures used by ArcGIS Pro.

**Note:** There are xx steps in this assignment.

## Grading.

The assignment is worth 30 points, based on a Word document (or PDF) you will upload to Canvas containing:
1. Three screenshots: the unstyled Kentucky layer, the 'ugly map', and your much-improved 'attractive' map. Paste these three images into your Word document (15 points).
2. Responses to the three questions in the assignment (15 points).

Consult the [syllabus schedule](../syllabus.md#viii-schedule) for the due date of this assignment. **Note:** Late submissions will be penalized, as discussed in the syllabus.

**Note:** This assignment requires access to ArcGIS Pro. This desktop software is available in the teaching lab (CB313) and may be available in other computer labs on campus. You will also need to be able to save files locally.

## Instructions.

1. Print, find in a magazine, or draw a favorite celebrity or character. Cut out the celebrity and mount it to a Popsicle stick or pencil.

2. Take your celebrity on a tour of Lexington, taking photos along the way. Explore places you’ve never been! Photographing your celebrity in multiple places enriches the final collaborative map.

3. Select three photos from your Lexington tour and rename them
by right-clicking the file, and selecting ‘rename.’ Use the following naming convention: *yourlastname_#*.jpg (e.g., wilson_1.jpg, wilson_2.jpg, wilson_3.jpg).

4. Create/sign into a [Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/). Your g.UKY email will likely not work for this assignment, even if you use the Gmail version). You must start by signing into a non-UKY Google account. **Note:** If you object to creating a non-UKY Google account, please inform your TA.

5. Navigate to the Google MyMaps for our class, [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yE3DQCQvpT6YlbqdeQX6xj0jo7tmA_Wu&usp=sharing). **Note:** In order to edit this map you must be logged into your non-UKY Google account.

6. Add a new marker at the location of your first photo using the marker tool.<br>![Google MyMaps Marker](assets/images/googlemymaps-add-marker.png)

7. Use the camera icon to upload your first photo and add a couple sentences to describe what your celebrity was doing in this location.<br> ![Google MyMaps Add Photo and Narrative](assets/images/googlemymaps-add-image.png)

8. Congratulations! You have geotagged your first image. Take a screenshot of this geotagged image using print screen (PtrScr key Windows or Command-Shift-3 in MacOS). Now open the Word doc you will be turning in, and paste/upload your screenshot. **Note:** You will need all three screenshots of your geotagged images to receive full credit.

9. In your Word doc, below your three screenshots of your three geotagged images, please write a 250-word essay using the  prompt, [above](mapping-1-instructions.md#grading).

10. Upload this Word doc to Canvas before the due date.
