In this exercise, the class will produce a Google Map of hundreds of geotagged photos documenting celebrity sightings in Lexington. Your job is to 1) photograph a chosen celebrity at three locations in Lexington, and 2) add those photos, along with some descriptive text, to a class-wide collaborative map using Google MyMaps.

## Grading.

The assignment is worth 25 points, based on a Word document you will upload to Canvas containing:
1. Three screenshots demonstrating that you successfully geotagged three images to the collaborative map (15 points). Paste these three images into your Word document.
2. A 250-word essay (10 points) responding to the following prompt: **How does the collaboratively-produced map reflect the specific geographies of our classmates?** Consider where geotagged images were posted and where they are absent (as well as what celebrities were selected and written about).
